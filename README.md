## COVIDguidelines - R source  and data

This project aims to provide a framework for making the results of the *Guidance Note on Assessing and Minimizing the Impact of a Crisis on Survey Quality: Approaches Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic* replicable using the R software for statistical computing. 

## Description
Reproducibility is a crucial aspect of official statistics, and this project seeks to address the consistency with the results of the Guidance Note. We aim to share data, code, and methods, enabling others to replicate the results and verify the validity of the findings. 

## Usage
After cloning the project, open the R project called _covidguidelines.Rproj_ in RStudio. Go to the folder _Rcodes_in the Files pane, and then open the file _GuidelinesRcodes.R_. Finally, execute the code line by line.
